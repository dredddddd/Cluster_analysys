# Cluster_analysys
* **DBSCAN**
* **Minimal spanning tree** - can find *epsilon* for DBSCAN
* **K-means**
* **K-means with kernels**
* **EM-algorithm** - and produce *gif*-image with all steps
* **FOREL** - 3 levels - points, centroids and centroids from centroids. Produce *gif*-image and 3 groups of clusters.
* **Hierarchical** - the linkage criterion is *Unweighted average linkage clustering* (or *UPGMA*)
