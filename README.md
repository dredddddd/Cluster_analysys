# Cluster_analysys

**This project is a sandbox in the field of machine learning, u can see here some clustering a**
Here are some clustering algorythms that are available at the moment:
* **DBSCAN**
* **Spanning tree** - can find *epsilon* for DBSCAN
* **K-means**
* **K-means with kernels**
* **EM-algorithm** - and produce *gif*-image with all steps
* **FOREL** - 3 levels - points, centroids and centroids from centroids. Produce *gif*-image and 3 groups of clusters.
* **Hierarchical** - the linkage criterion is *Unweighted average linkage clustering* (or *UPGMA*)

**U will totally need to look at *HELP.txt* so u can figure out how to put commands**

* **If u want to see client-server realisation go** [here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/Client_server) 

*There are both 'client.exe' and 'server.exe' for u to look at*

* **If u want to see non-client-server realisation go** [there](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/non_Client_server) 

* **U can find examples of plotting results of algorythm in gnu** [right here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/EXAMPLES)

PS. Command files are [here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/COMMAND FILES)
