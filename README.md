# Cluster_analysys

**This project is a sandbox in the field of machine learning, u can see here some clustering a**
Here are some clustering algorythms that are available at the moment:
* **DBSCAN**
* **Spanning tree** 
* **K-means**
* **K-means with kernels**
* **EM-algorithm** 
* **FOREL** 
* **Hierarchical** 

**U will totally need to look at *HELP.txt* so u can figure out how to put commands**

* **If u want to see client-server realisation go** [here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/Client_server) 

*There are both 'client.exe' and 'server.exe' for u to look at*

To use client server, at first start '**Cluster_analysys.cpp**' then start '**client.cpp**' print commands in command line

* **If u want to see non-client-server realisation go** [there](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/non_Client_server) 

* **U can find examples of plotting results of algorythm in gnu** [right here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/EXAMPLES)

PS. Command files are [here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/COMMAND%20FILES) and exe's are [here](https://github.com/dredddddd/Cluster_analysys/tree/main/EXE's%20(separated))
